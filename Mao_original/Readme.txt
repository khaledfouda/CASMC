@ code
the files "mao_coop.R" and "SMC_functions6.R" contain the necessary code to run the proposed method. You should start with the file "mao_coop.R".

@ example
the file "sim_1_maoxz.R" shows, using an exmple, how to run the prooposed method. It also allwos to compare the proposed method to
  - Soft impute method  "soft_mc.R";
